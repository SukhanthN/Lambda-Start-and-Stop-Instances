AWS Lambda:
-----------
AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you Run code without thinking about servers or clusters.

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or 
backend service without provisioning or managing servers. 
You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

IDE ( integrated development environment) (pycham)

In test environment no production servers we use lot of test servers by mistake we forgot to stop the system we will get a bill
24*7. I want to stop all EC2 instances in the night. we can write the program using Lambda Functions. 
It can any code python, java or .net.

--> prerequisites
	> code (python) ---> Stop
	> scheduling program scheduler ( if it is Linux cron job your going to tell this python program should exextute at 7 O'clack
	in the evening it will automatically run the program. 
	if is is windows system we have to use task scheduler. you need to tell python program should exextute every one hour.

		> Create a new task > task Name > new srigger.
		> Cloud watch > Events > Rules > create a reule.
	> where should this code 
	> top 6 langauge in the world any langauge it will support. any langauge we can wirte it.
	> cron job is the extension of advaced scheduling.

Lambda Functions	(IMP)

--> scheduling Based  Every 5 imns, 10, 15, 20  (LM Lambda Functions > code > code prient > Cloud watch 
(every thing is watch by what went worong by everthing)

--> Event Based ec2-stop, ec2-start, ec2-delete, s3-put,get object anything like all this things are called as AWS Event.
When ever this event happen Lambda code will exextuted.

--> Any bigger > any time > any where > that si LF API.		(Contries api)

Lambda Functions Limitations
	> we Lambda Functions code that can be exextuted for one hour only. now you have any program where it has to go exextute 
	for three to four hours Lambda Function is not courrect one. Because of the time out is maximum one hour so program after
	trminate is self timeout is specified is one hour only. Based on the timeout you can go for it.

Stops the EC2 instances


import boto3
region = 'us-east-1'
instances = ['i-03d2341f9ba7e9823', 'i-0253c9bd715c5164e']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('stopped your instances: ' + str(instances))
